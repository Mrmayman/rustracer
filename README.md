# Rustracer
My attempt at a real-time path tracer in Rust and WGPU.

This is based on the "Ray Tracing In One Weekend" book and its sequel.

# Build
- Install Rust
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Mrmayman/rustracer.git`
- Navigate inside the new grinding-metal folder `cd rustracer`
- Build and run it `cargo run --release`
